      The design and development team collaborate through iterative sprints, to
      build a product with great functionality and user experience. We’ll
      prioritize features in a product roadmap, and then tackle each section of
      the roadmap with a build sprint. The cyclical process of this phase is
      characterized by these stages: Sprint Planning, Sprint Build, QA, User
      Testing and Sprint Review.The iterative build, test, review process
      enables us to incorporate user feedback and prioritize the most critical
      features.

      Our goals during this phase is to define the idea, understand your
      business goals and the needs of your users. We may conduct stakeholder
      interviews, outline technical and business requirements, do a competitor
      analysis and run a technology audit. This groundwork is step one in the
      product design and development process. Once we identified the problem
      we’re solving and who the users are we can begin prototyping ideas and
      testing assumptions.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
