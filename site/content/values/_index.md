      The design and development team collaborate through iterative sprints, to
      build a product with great functionality and user experience. We’ll
      prioritize features in a product roadmap, and then tackle each section of
      the roadmap with a build sprint. The cyclical process of this phase is
      characterized by these stages: Sprint Planning, Sprint Build, QA, User
      Testing and Sprint Review.The iterative build, test, review process
      enables us to incorporate user feedback and prioritize the most critical
      features.
  - heading: Research & Discovery (1 - 2 Week Sprints)

      Our goals during this phase is to define the idea, understand your
      business goals and the needs of your users. We may conduct stakeholder
      interviews, outline technical and business requirements, do a competitor
      analysis and run a technology audit. This groundwork is step one in the
      product design and development process. Once we identified the problem
      we’re solving and who the users are we can begin prototyping ideas and
      testing assumptions.

      This is the best way to efficiently test ideas and validate assumptions.
      We’ll sketch possible solutions, based on all the risks identified and
      assumptions made during Research & Discovery phase. The design team will
      create interactive prototypes for users to test and offer feedback. We’ll
      also determine the team structure and capabilities for the project.
  - heading: Launch Preparations (1 - 2 weeks)

      We'll work with you every step of the way to make sure the launch is a
      success! When it’s time to hand off the product over to your team, we’ll
      offer training and maintenance to ensure a smooth transition.
  - heading: Maintenance & Growth (As needed)

      We'll be around after your product has launched to offer support as and
      when you need it. Maintenance might include upgrades, monitoring
      performance, fixing bugs and developing new functionality.
