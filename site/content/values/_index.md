      The design and development team collaborate through iterative sprints, to
      build a product with great functionality and user experience. We’ll
      prioritize features in a product roadmap, and then tackle each section of
      the roadmap with a build sprint. The cyclical process of this phase is
      characterized by these stages: Sprint Planning, Sprint Build, QA, User
      Testing and Sprint Review.The iterative build, test, review process
      enables us to incorporate user feedback and prioritize the most critical
      features.

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
