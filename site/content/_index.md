    Our goals during this phase is to define the idea, understand your business
    goals and the needs of your users. We may conduct stakeholder interviews,
    outline technical and business requirements, do a competitor analysis and
    run a technology audit. This groundwork is step one in the product design
    and development process. Once we identified the problem weâ€™re solving and
    who the users are we can begin prototyping ideas and testing assumptions.
