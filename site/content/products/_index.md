        Our goals during this phase is to define the idea, understand your
        business goals and the needs of your users. We may conduct stakeholder
        interviews, outline technical and business requirements, do a competitor
        analysis and run a technology audit.

        This is the best way to efficiently test ideas and validate assumptions.
        We’ll sketch possible solutions, based on all the risks identified and
        assumptions made during Research & Discovery phase. The design team will
        create interactive prototypes for you.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
