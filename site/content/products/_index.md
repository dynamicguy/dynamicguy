        Our goals during this phase is to define the idea, understand your
        business goals and the needs of your users. We may conduct stakeholder
        interviews, outline technical and business requirements, do a competitor
        analysis and run a technology audit. This groundwork is step one in the
        product design and development process. Once we identified the problem
        we’re solving and who the users are we can begin prototyping ideas and
        testing assumptions.

        We'll be around after your product has launched to offer support as and
        when you need it. Maintenance might include upgrades, monitoring
        performance, fixing bugs and developing new functionality.

        This is the best way to efficiently test ideas and validate assumptions.
        We’ll sketch possible solutions, based on all the risks identified and
        assumptions made during Research & Discovery phase. The design team will
        create interactive prototypes for users to test and offer feedback.
        We’ll also determine the team structure and capabilities for the
        project.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
