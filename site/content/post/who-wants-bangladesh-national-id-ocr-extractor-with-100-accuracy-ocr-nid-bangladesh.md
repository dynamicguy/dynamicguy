We just finished writing and testing a Bangladesh National ID data extractor with 100% accuracy. There are tons of potential use cases for this. As far as I know there is no such tool available. This software is written in python. These are the packages we used to achieve this:

* numpy
* dash
* imutils
* pytesseract
* opencv-python
* xlrd
* pandas
* pdf2image
* dash-canvas
