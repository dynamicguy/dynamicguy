PhotoMatic is an image search engine which let you index and search on your own images offline. This app has no third party dependencies except you have to install a standard Java runtime. We do support JPEG and PNG images at this time. 



## Features

We got features included but not limited to the following:

* Index a directory containing images recursively
* Browse the indexed images by numbers
* Search for an image from browse panel. Select an image from file system and search with it.
* Double click on an image in the results table to search with it



## Filters

PhotoMatic allows you to create a ranked list of results based on some similarity metric along with a low level image features. However, some times you need a filtering or re-ranking process to take place afterwards. Common use cases are if PhotoMatic search is applied to a large database on a fast but not very precise feature (e.g. hashing) and the resulting list has to be re-ranked according to a global feature. Re-ranking can also employ extended analysis method like Latent Semantic Analysis.
